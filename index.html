          The author chooses the Economic Complexity Index as a tool to understand sub-Saharan countries. The ECI, though, is a black box; even with a whole section trying to unpack its logic, it's a pretty difficult concept. The authors try to use it with other indexes such as the log of GDP as a way to see correlations and understand its behavior, but maybe there's a chance to translate its effects in real world with variables that are closer to real-life experiences. Hence, we intersect the ECI with not only its log of GDP per capita, but also the GINI. Here we have a 3-pointed index, pointing out different traits for each Country: their techincal abilities, their abundance and its effect on society.

          The years demarcated have a very strong political history in the years leading to their highest level of inequality, and all have also seen their most equal times in the years ahead except one country. South Africa had seen their most equal time in the years leading to the end of the apartheid, while being the only country to have gotten more unequal since their lowest Gini score. It is a bit mysterious as to what impactful events happened in the years leading to 2011, but looking at the UNDP Report as well as further research might help to shape an explanation that might also help find a solution to this high level of inequality.

        These visualizations examine commodity dependency and land inequality trends in Sub-Saharan Africa's primary sector (farming and extractives) from the mid-2000s until 2015, the most current reporting period.

        <details>
          <summary>Read more...</summary>
          Since "[a]griculture is Africa’s largest economic sector, representing 15 percent of the continent’s total GDP, or more than $100 billion annually" (McKinsey, 2010) and since farming represents 60 percent of all jobs on the continent (Brookings, 2016), crop yields, land ownership patterns, and productivity gains in tillage have an outsized impact on local economies. By the same token, since Africa holds 30 percent of the world’s mineral reserves, 10 percent of the world’s oil, and 8 percent of the world’s natural gas (World Bank 2017), the specter of the resource curse is never far from policymakers’ minds.

  Of particular concern to UNDP and the sustainable development community is reprimarization risk, which in simplest terms means a return to or backslide into primary commodities as the main source of export revenues, as opposed to upward growth in value-added goods and services.

  We invite you to explore these complex dynamics -- including Dutch disease and smallholder dualism -- in the accompanying pages.

          The numerical value for each inequality is the Atkinson Measure as reported by the UNDP in the 2015 Human Development Report [1]. The Atkinson Measure is a measure of inequality that varies between 0 and 1 -- or 0% and 100%, equivalently -- with 0 indicating no inequality and 1 indicating complete inequality. The visualization is a synthesized re-rendering of three charts found in Chapter 11 of Income Inequality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa [2], which plot the same data. The intended goal is to emphasize and clarify the connection between these three charts, providing a user-friendly way of tracking both the absolute and relative change undergone by each individual country betwen 2010 and 2014 in all three areas of inequality.

        This project explores the differences between the expected years of schooling and the mean years of schooling based on gender.
        <details>
          <summary>Read more...</summary>
          Africa has seen an increase in the number of school children gaining access to school. However, there still seems to be a gap based on differences. This data visualization project explores these differences. From the "Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa" report, we know that sub-Saharan Africa has experienced advancement in human development. However, the report also highlighted gender inequality and differences in human development based on gender. Since education is a factor in both calculating the Human Development Index, this data visualization project explores those differences by looking at differences in “expected years of schooling” and “mean years of schooling” by both male and female identified students. Expected years of schooling is defined as “number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child’s life” (Unesco). Mean years of schooling is calculated by averaging the number of years of school accomplished by individuals 25 years or over.

      <p class="col-md-9">
        This project aims to explore the effect of agriculture investment and productivity on the welfare and equitable share of resources in Africa. In this initial version, each country is represented by a vertical bar subdivided into one of the country's top 10 crops. The height of each crop is proportional to the share that crop holds out of the top 10 crops for that country.

        <details>
          <summary>Read more...</summary>
            An additional viewing dimension is the metric sorting the countries. Initially it currently defaults "Worker Productivity" measured in 2010 US dollars. The dropdown below the plot allows for additional metrics by which to sort the data. Similarly, one can change the year.

            By hovering over a segment, you can see additional information, such as the share a given crop holds out of the country's total crops, as well as the country's value on the current sorting metric.

            Upon clicking on a country, a country specific pane will reveal itself allowing the viewer further context into that country's current agricultural state. A further click on the country vertical bar will bring the viewer back to the main screen.

        This visualization focuses on income quintile trends in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Tanzania. These countries were chosen to represent three different types of inequality trends on the African continent: Ghana shows rising inequality, Burkina Faso falling, and Tanzania an inverted u-shaped ∩ inequality trend.

            Income quintiles are illustrated by two charts: a stacked bar chart to represent change in proportion of each country’s total income, and a positive/negative bar chart to illustrate percentage change. Text is generated from the data as the user interacts with the graphs.

            The World Development Indicators data used for this visualization is incomplete, so starting and ending years are different for each country. This created a challenge when trying to design a comparative visualization.

        This project seeks to look at the relationship between demographic developments and inequality trends, with a focus on urbanization. As world population continues to grow, an increasing number of people are moving to cities aspiring better living conditions, higher quality education and greater economic opportunities.
        <details>
          <summary>Read more...</summary>
            In 2008, for the first time in human history, half of the world’s population lived in towns and cities. Africa is currently the least urbanized continent, but its urbanization rate of 3.5 percent per year is the fastest in the world.
            
            In 1980, only 28 percent of Africans lived in urban areas. Today, the number of Africans living in cities is 40 percent, and is projected to grow to 50 percent by 2030. As this has immediate social-economic impacts, it is interesting to investigate the relation between urbanization data and inequality trends.

          Ayodele states in Income Inequality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa that as the economic status of women improves, so does the economic status of entire families. This visualization intends to show clear relationships between gender and income inequality, as well as educate the user on the calculation of male and female indexes. By understanding the impact of gender equality on income equality, and the difference in male and female indexes, we can work to raise female indexes, thus lowering gender and income inequality.

        Education quality, as a determining factor on social mobility/income inequality, tends to make itself known across long-term perspectives. With this as a guiding insight, this interactive visualisation tool is oriented towards macro-level, broad insights on the ways that educational access relate to and interact with income and social equality, on a country-by-country basis.

          Each map tracks a single metric across a time interval from 1970-2015- the Gini Income Inequality Coefficient, and two Net Enrolment Ratios(NER) for both Primary and Secondary Education. The year of each metric can be selected via the top slider, with tooltips displaying the specific data for each country.
